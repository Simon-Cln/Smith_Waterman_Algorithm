# Smith_Waterman_Algorithm

Analysis of protein structure and sequence is very important in bioinformatics, especially for understanding how cells 
work, which makes it easier to make drugs for metabolic pathways. Protein sequence 
alignment is a method for figuring out the relationships between different protein 
structures by finding the similarities between their structures.

The Smith-Waterman algorithm uses local sequence alignment to find similar regions 
between two strings of nucleic acid or protein sequences. Rather than comparing the 
entire sequence, the Smith-Waterman algorithm compares segments of varying lengths 
and optimizes the similarity measure.

This algorithm aims to compare the structures of two amino acids and is proposed for 
use in local sequence alignment in bioinformatics.
